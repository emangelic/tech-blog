# tech-blog

## Description

This tech blog is a basic tech blog platform designed for sharing articles, tutorials, and opinions on the latest in technology. This project was motivated by the desire to create a simple and user-friendly platform for tech enthusiasts to publish and read content. It addresses the need for a straightforward blog system that can be easily customized and expanded.

Through this project, I learned the essentials of web development, including front-end and back-end integration, database management, and deploying a web application.
